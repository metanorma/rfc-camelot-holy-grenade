[abstract]
The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in <<RFC8140>>
may be usefully supplemented by other renowned figures
of Internet and more general lore. This is a preliminary
attempt to extend the menagerie to the seminal fable of the
Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, as depicted in the Monty Python
film _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, as well as
_Spamalot_, the musical inspired by the movie.

[NOTE,remove-in-rfc=false]
.Spamalot
The relevance of the musical _Spamalot_ to Internet lore
should be obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt,
see also <<RFC2635,1 of What is Spam*?>>

== Terminology

In this document, the key words *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *REQUIRED*,
*SHALL*, *SHALL NOT*, *SHOULD*, *SHOULD NOT*, *RECOMMENDED*, *MAY*, and
*OPTIONAL* are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14, <<RFC2119>>.

== Introduction

<<RFC8140>> refers to the intended move of RFC formatting to
XML2RFC v3 <<RFC7790>>, in the following terms:

[quote,attribution="A. Farrel"]
____
Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
   screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996], there is a
   yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep it
   simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given
   thrust without anyone taking undue offence.
____

// end::quote[]
[.comment]
end::quote1[]

While no pigs, flying or otherwise, are involved in the transition
to RFC XML v3, it is opportune to enhance the <<RFC8140>> legendarium
in the service of RFC XML v3, by illustrating its functionality
through references to the mythology of Camelot, and particularly
the incidents at the Cave of Caerbannog.

There are two references to rabbits in _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_
which are expounded on herewith:

// tag::listcontinuation[]

Trojan Rabbit::
In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may already contain 
an instance of the Grail,
Sir Bedevere the Wise proposes to use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate
the castle, with a raiding party to take the French "not only by
surprise, but totally unarmed."
+
The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive. The more so as the
raiding party forgot to go inside the Trojan Rabbit before the French
take the Trojan Rabbit inside.
Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog::
Guarding the entrance to the Cave of Caerbannog; see <<caerbannog>>.

== The Mythos of Caerbannog

The _Cave of Caerbannog_ has been well-established in the mythology of
Camelot (as recounted by Monty Python) as the lair of the Legendary
Black Beast of Arrrghhh, more commonly known today as the
*Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*. It is the encounter between
the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog and the Knights of the Round Table,
armed with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, that we recount here
through monospace font and repeated spaces.

=== The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog

The *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*, that most formidable foe of
the Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been
depicted diversely in lay and in song.

<<killer_bunny,The following depiction>> of the fearsome beast
has been sourced from
http://ascii.co.uk/art/rabbit[RABBIT - ASCII ART], accompanied
by some C code that was certainly not utilised to generate it
(from https://github.com/symisc/ascii_art):

(_caer bannog_ being Welsh for "turreted
castle", thus making its title a pun on the English dish "Welsh
rabbit") is the home of the Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh
(((Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog)))
(named for the last utterance of anyone who ever saw it). This is
guarded by a monster which is initially unknown. ((King Arthur)) and
his knights are led to the cave by ((Tim the Enchanter)) and find that
they must face its guardian beast.

****
The rabbit scene was shot outside the Tomnadashan mine, a cave 4 miles
(6.5 km) from the Perthshire village of Killin. For the 25th
anniversary DVD, Michael Palin and Terry Jones returned to be
interviewed in front of the cave but they could not remember the
location.

What is Lancelot's favourite colour? Will come in handy later.

The solution to the impasse at the Cave of Caerbannog was provided
by the successful deployment of the *Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch*.
Any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and the
mythical _Holy Spear of Antioch_ is purely intention; any similarity
between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and the
_Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom_ is purely fortuitous.

[.comment]
tag::dl1[]
// tag::dl[]

Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch::
  Ordnance deployed by Brother Maynard under the incantation of a lector,
  in order to dispense with the Foes of the Virtuous.
Holy Spear of Antioch::
  A supposed relic of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, this is one of at least 
  four claimed instances of the lance that pierces Christ's side. Its
  historical significance lies in inspiring crusaders to continue their
  siege of Antioch in 1098.
Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom::
  Part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign's Orb
  is a hollow gold sphere set with jewels and topped with a cross. It was
  made for Charles II in 1661.

The Holy Hand
Grenade is described as one of the "sacred relics" carried by Brother
Maynard. Despite its ornate appearance and long-winded instructions,
it functions much the same as any other hand grenade. At King Arthur's
prompting, instructions for its use are read aloud from the fictitious
_Book of Armaments_, Chapter 2, verses 9-21.

NOTE: Verses parodying the King James Bible and the Athanasian Creed.

[keep-with-previous=true]
[quote,Book of Armaments 2:9-21,
  https://genius.com/Monty-python-holy-hand-grenade-of-antioch-lyrics]
And Saint Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,
"O *LORD*, bless this Thy hand grenade that with it Thou
[bcp14]#mayest# blow Thine enemies to tiny bits, in Thy mercy." And
the *LORD* did grin and
the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies
and orangutans and breakfast cereals, and fruit bats and large chu...
[At this point, the friar is urged by ((Brother Maynard)) to
"skip a bit, brother"]... And the *LORD* spake, saying, "First
[bcp14]#shalt# thou take out the Holy Pin, then [bcp14]#shalt# thou
count to three, no more, no less. Three
[bcp14]#shall# be the number thou [bcp14]#shalt# count, and the number
of the counting [bcp14]#shall# be three. Four [bcp14]#shalt# thou not
count, neither count thou two,
excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once
the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest
thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who being
naughty in My sight, [bcp14]#shall# snuff it."

The instructions in the _Book of Armaments_ on the proper deployment of
the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch may be summarised as follows:

[.comment]
tag::ol1[]
// tag::ol[]

. Preamble: St Attila Benediction
. Feast of the People on Sundry Foods
** Lambs
** Sloths
** Carp
** Anchovies
** Orangutangs
** Breakfast Cereals
** Fruit Bats
** _et hoc genus omne_
. Take out the Holy Pin
. The Count
[upperalpha]
.. Count is to Three: no more, no less
.. Not Four
.. Nor Two, except if the count then proceeds to Three
.. Five is Right Out
. Lob the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards the Foe
. The Foe, being naughty in the *LORD's* sight, [bcp14]#shall# snuff it

// end::ol[]
[.comment]
end::ol1[]

This could also be represented in pseudocode as follows:

[.comment]
tag::listcontinuationblock1[]
// tag::listcontinuationblock[]

. Take out the Holy Pin
. The Count
+
----
integer count;
for count := 1 step 1 until 3 do
  say(count)
comment Five is Right Out
----
. Lob the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards the Foe
. Foe snuffs it
